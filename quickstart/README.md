# QuickStart

Here, we provide some script files for data import, query parameter filling and latency comparison. Please note that you need to change the file path to the folder where your data and queries are located, and you should first refer to the tutorial under run examples to learn how to use Touchstone to generate data.

## SSB-EXP
load: The scripts for loading data.
ssb-query: The scripts for filling query template with the parameters produces by Touchstone.
ssb-test: The scripts for comparing latency with dbgen and Touchstone.

## TPCH-EXP
load: The scripts for loading data.
tpch-query: The scripts for filling query template with the parameters produces by Touchstone.
tpch-test: The scripts for comparing latency with dbgen and Touchstone.
