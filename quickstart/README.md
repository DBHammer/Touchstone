# QuickStart

Here, we provide some script files for data importing, query parameter filling and latency comparison. Please note that you need to change the file path to the folder where your data and queries are located.  Before using these scripts, you should first refer to the tutorial under `run examples` to learn how to use Touchstone.

## SSB-EXP
+ load: The scripts for loading data.
+ ssb-query: The scripts for filling query templates with the parameters produced by Touchstone.
+ ssb-test: The scripts for comparing latency with dbgen and Touchstone.

## TPCH-EXP
+ load: The scripts for loading data.
+ tpch-query: The scripts for filling query templates with the parameters produced by Touchstone.
+ tpch-test: The scripts for comparing latency with dbgen and Touchstone.
